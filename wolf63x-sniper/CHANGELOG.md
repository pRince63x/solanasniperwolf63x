# Wolf63x Solana Sniper Bot - Changelog

## [Version 0.2.3] - 2025-04-22

### Backend Improvements

- Replaced deprecated `requests` crate with `reqwest` (v0.11) to resolve yanked dependencies.
- Implemented HTTP fallback fetch from Pump.fun API using `reqwest` ensuring the pairs menu is never empty.
- Refactored websocket listener to use the minimal `NewTokenEvent` struct and convert to `TokenOpportunity` for frontend display.

### Frontend/UI Enhancements

- Pairs menu now updates in real time via Pump.fun WebSocket and HTTP fallback.
- UI preview auto-refreshes with the latest token pairs, resolving previous empty menu issues.

  - No movement/translation on click for a minimal, modern feel.
  - Ensures a perfectly unified design language across navigation and all interactive elements.
- **Real-Time Pairs Menu:**
  - The "Pairs" menu now fetches and displays newly listed memecoins from pump.fun every 0.3 seconds for near-instant updates.
